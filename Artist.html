  Three friends, Makalya, Kassia, and Kayla have started a natural hair brand called <br />
"knotted.up". Initially the girls started the buisness to answer these questions, 
through hair tutorials, but expanded their brand objective to teaching youth their age how to take care of their hair and ultimately have fun with it.<br />
