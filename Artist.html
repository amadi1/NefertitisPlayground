<p>Noticing the numerous questions people had about their kinks, coils,and fro's: <br />
  Three friends, Makalya, Kassia, and Kayla have started a natural hair brand called <br />
"knotted.up". Initially the girls started the buisness to answer these questions, 
through hair tutorials, but expanded their brand objective to teaching youth age how to take care of their hair and ultimately have fun with it.<br />
These young women are also in the process of creating different hair accessories and kinds of apparel, 
such as shirts and hats, which is available here: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fbooster.com%2Fknotteduptees&h=MAQHOOkFP"> Page</a> <br />
